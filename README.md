I'm getting

KeyError: Gender 

when i run the program

Oddly, I only get it when I choose Washington while running the program (the user gets to choose from Washington, New York, and Chicago).

I've tried titling a new csv file as 'washington.csv', but still get the problem.  And 'Gender' is a column in all three cities' csv files (I've checked the column headings, they all say "Gender").  So the problem must be in one of the dictionaries, but i can't see any typos.  Yet the dictionaries don't have 'Gender' in them.

A puzzle.

Thanks for your help,
